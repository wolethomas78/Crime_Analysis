## KPI: 
### YTD vs PYTD Crime and Reporting Lag (2020â€“2025)

This section tracks **Year-to-Date (YTD)** vs **Previous Year-to-Date (PYTD)** crime volumes and **Average Report Lag Days**, filtered by year and crime severity (`Not Severe`, `Severe`).

---

### KPI Visual Setup

- **KPI Cards**:
  -  Crime YTD & PYTD
  -  Avg Report Lag Days (YTD & PYTD)
- **Slicers**:
  - Year (2020â€“2025)
  - Crime Severity (Severe / Not Severe)

---

### Key Insights

- ðŸ”¸ **Lag Time Improvement**:  
  Report lag has decreased dramatically from 2020 to 2025 in both crime categories (e.g., Not Severe from 32.15 â†’ 1.31 days).
  
- ðŸ”¸ **Crime Volume Trends**:  
  - From 2020â€“2023, crime counts steadily increased.
  - In **2024â€“2025**, both Not Severe and Severe crimes dropped sharply.

---

### Interpretation

- Decreasing report lag suggests operational efficiency gains and improved data systems.
- Sudden crime drops in 2024â€“2025 may reflect **NIBRS system transition**, **underreporting**, or **reporting delays**, not necessarily lower crime.

---

### Recommendations

1. **Enhance Real-Time Reporting**  
   â†’ Expand mobile/digital tools to maintain low report lag times.

2. **Audit 2024â€“2025 Data Drops**  
   â†’ Validate if declines are due to system change or real reductions.

3. **Create Monitoring Thresholds**  
   â†’ Set automated alerts for major changes in crime count or lag time.

  ## Gendered Crime Trends
### Gender-Based Crime Victim Analysis (2020â€“2025)

This section of the dashboard analyzes gender distribution among crime victims from 2020 to 2025, categorized by **crime severity** (`Severe` vs `Not Severe`), using official LAPD data.

---

### Chart Referenced

![alt image](https://github.com/wolethomas78/Crime_Analysis/blob/8568ad54f4f8f5206d6114f3e2e6b69eb1390d1c/victim_gender.png)
- **Visual**: Single Pie Chart  
- **Slicers**:  
  - `Year` (2020â€“2025)  
  - `Crime Severity` (Severe / Not Severe)  
- **Values**: Victim Gender (%)

The pie chart dynamically updates to show the male-to-female ratio for the selected year and crime type.

---

### Key Observations

- **Not Severe Crimes (2020â€“2024)**: Female victims consistently outnumbered males.
- **Not Severe Crimes (2025)**: Reversal â€” male victims increased to 53.57%.
- **Severe Crimes**: Male victims dominate every year, peaking at **87.5% in 2025**.
- The **2025 severe crime gender split** is unusually extreme.

---

### Interpretation

- Not severe crimes affect **females more often**, especially in earlier years.
- Severe crimes are consistently **male-dominated**, suggesting higher male exposure to violent crime.
- The **2025 spike in male severe crime victims** and drop in female victims likely signals a data shift, reporting issue, or social trend.

---

### Impact

- Gender-targeted crime prevention policies may need to be **rebalanced**.
- Sudden changes in 2025 indicate a need to **validate reporting quality** after LAPDâ€™s switch to the **NIBRS system**.
- Community safety strategies must adapt to **shifting victim profiles**.

---

### Recommendations

1. **Audit 2025 severe crime data** to verify anomaly or real trend shift.
2. **Adjust community programs**: Support women for minor crime prevention, target men for violence prevention.
3. **Monitor male victimization trends** â€” especially in 2025.
4. **Use this interactive pie chart** for ongoing crime pattern reviews.
5. **Document data limitations post-NIBRS transition** to maintain transparency.

## Monthly Crime Trend Analysis (2020â€“2025)

This section analyzes monthly crime volumes by severity type using slicers for year and crime classification (Not Severe vs Severe). It reveals key seasonal trends, reporting irregularities, and system-driven data gaps.

---

### Key Insights

#### Not Severe Crimes
- **Consistent seasonality (2020â€“2023)**: Higher crime in springâ€“fall; dips in winter months.
- **Sharp decline in 2024â€“2025**: Monthly volumes drop significantly; 2025 data nearly absent.

#### Severe Crimes
- **Strong upward trend (2020â€“2023)** with sustained high volumes.
- **Abrupt collapse in 2024â€“2025**, suggesting **reporting or system-level issues**.

---

### Interpretation

- Monthly patterns until 2023 suggest **predictable crime cycles** that can support seasonal policing strategies.
- The **abrupt drop** in 2024â€“2025 across both categories aligns with the **LAPDâ€™s transition to NIBRS**, indicating **data disruption or delayed reporting**, not necessarily a real decline in crime.

---

### Recommendations

1. **Investigate RMS Transition Effects on 2024â€“2025 Data**
   - Confirm if low volumes stem from **technical disruptions, delayed integration**, or **data entry backlogs** caused by the NIBRS-compliant system transition.

2. **Use 2020â€“2023 Seasonality for Predictive Safety Planning**
   - Apply historical monthly trends to **pre-position law enforcement resources** in high-activity months (e.g., summer & holidays).

3. **Align Stakeholders on Data Transition Status**
   - Communicate clearly with policy teams, law enforcement, and community stakeholders that **2024â€“2025 data gaps are transitional**, not indicative of real-world crime reduction.

## Top 5 Crime Types (2020â€“2025)
![alt image](https://github.com/wolethomas78/Crime_Analysis/blob/b286589143cfd89cd905c20a2548a00c33671c26/top5.png)

### Chart Referenced
**Bar Chart** showing the **Top 5 crime types per year**, filtered using slicers for:
- **Year**
- **Crime Severity (Not Severe / Severe)**

---

### Observation

- **Not Severe Crimes (2020â€“2023):**
  - Consistently high: `Battery - Simple Assault`, `Vandalism (Felony)`, and `Theft of Identity`.
  - Notable increase in **identity theft**, peaking at **22.2K in 2022**.
  - `Intimate Partner - Simple Assault` also ranks high.
  - Sudden volume drop in **2024â€“2025** across all crimes.

- **Severe Crimes (2020 data shown):**
  - Top 5: `Vehicle Theft (20.8K)`, `Burglary`, `Assault with Deadly Weapon`, `Burglary from Vehicle`, and `Petty Theft`.
  - These represent **property and violent crimes** with the greatest social and economic impact.

---

### Interpretation

- **Criminal behavior patterns** remain consistent in earlier years, suggesting repeat-offense environments and persistent social factors.
- The **2024â€“2025 drop** likely reflects **reporting system transition issues (RMS/NIBRS)**, not actual crime reduction.
- **Vehicle-related crimes and assault** dominate severe categories, showing need for focused deterrents.

---

### Impact

- **Strategic planning risks** if stakeholders misinterpret 2024â€“2025 data as real declines.
- Informed resource allocation becomes challenging without **clarity on top crime drivers**.
- Missed opportunity for targeted policing in areas like **identity theft**, which is clearly rising.

---

### Recommendations

1. **Launch Focused Intervention Campaigns**
   - Design **community outreach, digital literacy, and neighborhood watch** initiatives around:
     - `Battery - Simple Assault`
     - `Identity Theft`
     - `Vehicle Theft`

2. **Use Historical Top 5 Trends for Predictive Policing**
   - Leverage 2020â€“2023 trends to build models that predict **likely top crimes in future months**.

3. **Prioritize High-Impact Crimes in Resource Deployment**
   - Law enforcement should **target top severe crimes** (e.g., stolen vehicles, burglary) with **tech-driven tracking and patrol shifts**.

## Crime Committed by Status (2020â€“2025)

![alt image](https://github.com/wolethomas78/Crime_Analysis/blob/31608d372ee375836845117115e14a72f29a1d6e/invst.png)

### Chart Referenced
**Matrix Table** displaying the number of crimes by **offender status**:
- **Status Types:** Investigation Continued, Adult Arrest, Adult Other, Juvenile Arrest, Juvenile Other
- **Slicers Used:** 
  - Year (2020â€“2025)
  - Crime Severity (Not Severe / Severe)

---

### Observation

- **Investigation Continued** status dominates for both severe and not severe crimes, making up **~75%â€“85%** of records.
- **Adult Arrests** remain relatively stable between **9Kâ€“11K** yearly (2020â€“2023), declining sharply in **2024â€“2025**.
- **Juvenile involvement** (arrests + other) remains low overall but increases in **2023**.
- **Significant drops in all categories** from **2024 onward**, with **2025 showing near-zero counts**, likely due to reporting issues.

---

### Interpretation

- High "Investigation Continued" figures suggest that a majority of cases **remain open or unresolved**, raising concern about **case closure rates**.
- Stable adult arrest numbers followed by sharp declines indicate a **data transition effect** tied to LAPDâ€™s RMS/NIBRS migration.
- Juvenile crime, while lower in volume, shows **a gradual increase through 2023**, suggesting a trend worth monitoring.

---

### Impact

- **Operational bottlenecks** may exist in investigative workflows due to the large volume of unresolved cases.
- **Drop in 2024â€“2025 data** may lead to **misleading conclusions** if not flagged in dashboards.
- **Juvenile crime growth** in recent years could impact youth safety and community development if not addressed early.

---

### Recommendations

1. **Flag Transition-Impacted Years**
   - Clearly annotate **2024â€“2025** as years impacted by **reporting delays or system changes** in all visuals and exports.

2. **Audit Open Investigations**
   - Investigate the **backlog of continued cases**, especially in severe crimes, to evaluate **resource or procedural delays**.

3. **Enhance Arrest Reporting Integration**
   - Ensure arrest data is **fully integrated into new RMS/NIBRS systems** to restore trend continuity post-2023.

4. **Target Juvenile Crime with Early Interventions**
   - Launch **after-school programs, mentorship initiatives, and law enforcement-community partnerships** to reduce youth involvement.

---
